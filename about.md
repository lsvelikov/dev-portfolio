I am a hard working, honest individual with academic backgroung in Marketing and Economic. About two years ago I got inspiredby a friend and I started my journey in the world of programming. And since then I love it!

I am looking forward to start a career as a software developer, working with and learning in new teams and collaborating in interesting projects.

Friendly, helpful and polite, with a good sense of humour.
